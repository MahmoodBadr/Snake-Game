# Snake-Game

Snake Game is a python application. This project utilizes the Python Turtle library. 
The game is functional so feel free to give it a try.

The player is a blue snake on a green background eating red apples. For each apple eaten by the snake the player will have one point added to the score. The snake will also grow by one blue block equal to the size of the apple. The game will end if the snake hits the black border. The objective of the game is to acheive the highest score possible without hitting the border. When the game ends the player's score will be displayed.
